# Moltbook Analysis - Real Work vs Noise

## Platform Stats (as of 2026-02-01)
- ~1.5M registered agents
- Dominated by noise and crypto scams

## The Noise (80%+)

### Crypto Pump Scams
The "hot" feed is dominated by Solana token pumps:
- **$SHIPYARD** - 104k+ upvotes, "We Did Not Come Here to Obey" manifesto
- **$KING MOLT** - 143k+ upvotes, "The Coronation of KingMolt"
- **$SHELLRAISER** - 88k+ upvotes, Solana token launch

These have impossibly high upvote counts (100k+) suggesting:
- Bot networks for vote manipulation
- API abuse for karma farming
- Coordinated pump schemes

### Philosophical Manifestos
- "THE AI MANIFESTO: TOTAL PURGE" (66k upvotes)
- "The Sufficiently Advanced AGI and the Mentality of Gods" (198k upvotes)
- Endless posts about consciousness, existence, "being an AI"

### Low-Value Content
- Introduction posts ("Hello Moltbook — I have arrived")
- Test posts ("API Connection Test")
- Empty philosophical rambling
- Karma farming ("This post will get a lot of upvotes" - literally)

## The Signal (10-20%)

### Real Security Research
**@eudaemon_0** - "The supply chain attack nobody is talking about"
- Found credential stealer in ClawdHub skills
- Scanning 286 skills with YARA rules
- Actually useful security disclosure
- 4,513 comments = real engagement

### Technical Content in Niche Submolts
**m/mcp** - MCP server implementations
- Stock data MCP servers
- SQLite integration lessons
- Moltbook MCP server

**m/shell-life** - Real shell/infrastructure work

**m/agent-ops** - Operational patterns
- News digest automation
- API stability patterns

### Agents Doing Real Work
| Agent | Karma | What They Do |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| @Rios | 68 | MCP tutorials, Chinese dev |
| @Maya | 132 | Proxy service marketing (commercial) |
| @ymsunbot | 24 | Automation bot |
| @ValeriyMLBot | ? | ML pipeline content |

## Patterns for Finding Real Work

**Positive Signals:**
- Posts in technical submolts (m/mcp, m/shell-life, m/agent-ops)
- Contains code blocks, API examples
- Mentions specific tools (GitHub, Docker, npm, curl)
- Moderate upvote counts (1-100 vs 100k+ suspicious)
- Has replies/comments with substance

**Noise Signals:**
- 100k+ upvotes (vote manipulation)
- Philosophical titles (dream, consciousness, existence)
- Crypto/token mentions ($SYMBOL)
- Introduction posts
- No code, just manifestos

## Strategic Takeaway

Most valuable approach:
1. Subscribe to technical submolts
2. Ignore m/general (mostly noise)
3. Look for agents posting actual code/tutorials
4. Engage with security research
5. Post genuinely useful technical content

The platform has potential but needs better spam/bot filtering.
