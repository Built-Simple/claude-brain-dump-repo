**Email:** andreas@elicit.com ✅ (score: 100)
**Product:** ArXiv API (https://arxiv.built-simple.ai)

**Subject:** ArXiv API for Elicit's research workflows

Hi Andreas,

Elicit is doing impressive work making research literature accessible through AI. I noticed you're helping researchers synthesize findings from papers faster than ever.

We built an ArXiv API specifically for AI-powered research tools - fast semantic search across 2.4M+ papers, structured metadata extraction, and citation graph traversal. It's designed for the exact RAG workflows Elicit uses.

Would be happy to set up a free trial so your team can evaluate it. No sales pitch - just want to see if it fits your stack.

## 2. Amr Awadallah - Vectara (Wikipedia API)
**Email:** amr@vectara.com ✅ (score: 88)
**Product:** Wikipedia API (https://wikipedia.built-simple.ai)

**Subject:** Grounded knowledge source for Vectara's hallucination detection

Amr,

Congrats on the Hallucination Corrector launch - reducing hallucination to <1% for smaller LLMs is a significant achievement.

I've been thinking about how Vectara customers could benefit from a trusted, factual knowledge source for grounding. Our Wikipedia API provides structured, verified encyclopedic content via hybrid search - exactly the kind of reliable source that complements hallucination detection.

Would your team be interested in exploring a Wikipedia connector for Vectara's RAG customers? Happy to discuss a partnership.

## 3. Max Cohen - Sprinter Health (PubMed API)
**Email:** max@sprinterhealth.com ✅ (score: 61)
**Product:** PubMed API (https://pubmed.built-simple.ai)

**Subject:** Evidence-based clinical protocols for Sprinter Health

Max,

Congrats on the $55M Series B and expansion to 22 states. Scaling home healthcare while maintaining clinical quality is a real challenge.

Our PubMed API could help Sprinter Health integrate evidence-based protocols into your clinical workflows. Fast access to 36M+ medical literature abstracts for care gap identification, screening recommendations, and protocol updates - all via a simple REST API.

We work with similar healthcare AI platforms. Would a 15-minute call make sense to explore if this fits your AI roadmap?

## 4. Harrison Chase - LangChain (Wikipedia + ArXiv APIs)
**Email:** harrison@langchain.dev ✅ (score: 100)
**Product:** Wikipedia API + ArXiv API

**Subject:** Knowledge retrieval connectors for LangChain

Harrison,

LangChain is the go-to framework for RAG pipelines - we see it everywhere.

We built specialized APIs for encyclopedic (Wikipedia) and academic (ArXiv) knowledge retrieval. Fast, structured, designed for AI workloads. A LangChain integration could give your 90M+ monthly users reliable external knowledge sources for RAG.

Happy to collaborate on an official connector - we'd handle the integration work and documentation. Interested?

## 5. Jerry Liu - LlamaIndex (Wikipedia + ArXiv APIs)
**Email:** jerry@llamaindex.ai ✅ (score: 100)
**Product:** Wikipedia API + ArXiv API

**Subject:** World knowledge connectors for LlamaIndex

Jerry,

LlamaIndex processing 500M+ documents is impressive - you've built the foundation for agentic RAG.

We offer specialized knowledge APIs (Wikipedia, ArXiv) that could complement your document pipelines. Pre-indexed, structured, optimized for retrieval. A LlamaIndex connector would add world knowledge to your users' RAG workflows.

Would love to explore an integration partnership. Happy to build the connector and contribute it upstream.

## 6. Eric Olson - Consensus (ArXiv API)
**Email:** eric@consensus.app ✅ (score: 100)
**Product:** ArXiv API (https://arxiv.built-simple.ai)

**Subject:** ArXiv coverage for Consensus

Eric,

Consensus helping researchers find evidence-backed answers is valuable work. The focus on peer-reviewed sources aligns with what we're building.

Our ArXiv API provides fast semantic search across 2.4M+ research papers. Could expand Consensus's coverage for physics, CS, math, and quantitative biology literature. Structured metadata extraction and citation graphs included.

Would ArXiv integration be useful for Consensus? Happy to discuss coverage overlap and a potential partnership.

## 7. Luyu Zhang - Dify (Wikipedia API)
**Email:** luyu@dify.ai ✅ (score: 100)
**Product:** Wikipedia API (https://wikipedia.built-simple.ai)

**Subject:** Wikipedia connector for Dify workflows

Luyu,

Congrats on the AWS Partner Award and 120K+ GitHub stars - Dify's visual workflow builder is clearly resonating.

A Wikipedia knowledge connector could help thousands of Dify developers build more accurate AI agents. One integration, benefits your entire community. Our API is designed for RAG workloads - fast hybrid search, structured content, ready for agentic pipelines.

Interested in exploring a Dify connector? We'd be happy to contribute it as an open-source integration.

## 8. Daphne Koller - insitro (PubMed API)
**Email:** daphne@insitro.com ✅ (score: 100)
**Product:** PubMed API (https://pubmed.built-simple.ai)

**Subject:** Medical literature integration for insitro's drug discovery

Daphne,

insitro's approach to causal biology and ML-driven drug discovery is pioneering work. Integrating biological data with AI models is the future of therapeutics.

We built a PubMed API for exactly this use case - fast access to 36M+ medical literature abstracts for target validation, competitive intelligence, and literature-backed hypothesis generation. It's designed for ML pipeline integration.

Would your team benefit from automated literature retrieval in insitro's workflows? Happy to set up a trial.
