2. **Lead with use case** - "Power your AI tutor with structured encyclopedia knowledge"
3. **Offer free trial** - Low barrier to test integration
4. **Show competitors** - If one edtech adopts, others follow

### Email Template:
```
Subject: Knowledge API for [Company Name]'s AI features

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is building [specific AI/search feature]. 

We've built a fast, structured Wikipedia API that several edtech companies 
use to power their knowledge search, AI tutors, and content enrichment tools.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo to see if it fits your stack?

API docs: https://wikipedia.built-simple.ai

Best,
[Name]
```

## Notes

- **Email pattern research:** Most edtech companies use first@company.com or first.last@company.com
- **Best entry point:** CTOs and CPOs are most receptive to API products
- **Timing:** Many edtech companies are investing heavily in AI features (2024-2026)
- **Competition:** Some may already use Wikipedia directly - emphasize speed, structure, and reliability
