## Outreach Templates

### Cold Email Template - Research/Engineering Lead

```
Subject: ArXiv API for [Company] research workflows

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company]'s impressive work on [specific paper/product]. Your team's research velocity is notable.

We built an ArXiv API (arxiv.built-simple.ai) that several ML teams use for:
- Programmatic paper search & retrieval  
- Integration with RAG pipelines
- Automated research monitoring

Given [Company]'s focus on [their focus area], thought this might accelerate your team's literature review workflow.

Worth a quick demo?
