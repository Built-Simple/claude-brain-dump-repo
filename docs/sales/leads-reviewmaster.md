## 7. Outreach Strategy Recommendations

### Quick Wins (Low effort, high conversion)

1. **Single-location restaurants actively responding to reviews** - They care about reputation but spend time doing it manually
2. **Small restaurant groups (3-10 locations)** - Pain point is scaling review responses
3. **Agencies already doing review management manually** - Efficiency gain is obvious

### High-Value Targets (More effort, bigger deals)

1. **Regional restaurant groups (10-50 locations)** - Lettuce Entertain You, Cameron Mitchell, Ciccio
2. **Ghost kitchen operators** - Multiple virtual brands need separate response strategies
3. **DSOs** - Dental groups have similar review challenges at scale

### Partnership Priorities

1. **Toast API integration** - Largest restaurant POS, credibility boost
2. **Restaurant marketing agency white-label** - Leverage existing relationships
3. **GatherUp/Reviewflowz users frustrated with pricing** - Direct competitor displacement
