## 📊 Sending Best Practices

### Best Days/Times (B2B Cold Email Data)
| Day | Performance | Best Times (Recipient Local) |
|-----|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Tuesday** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Best | 9-10am, 1-2pm |
| **Wednesday** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great | 9-10am, 1-2pm |
| **Thursday** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great | 9-10am |
| Monday | ⭐⭐ Okay | After 10am only |

## 🚫 What NOT To Do (Spam Triggers)

### Subject Line Killers
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- "Quick question" (overdone)
- "Re:" or "Fwd:" when it's not a reply
- Dollar signs or "free" / "discount"
- Urgency words: "Act now", "Limited time"

### Body Copy Mistakes
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Just following up" (as opener)
- Walls of text (keep under 150 words)
- Multiple CTAs (pick ONE)
- Attachments in first email
- Generic company descriptions
- Talking about yourself before their problem

### Technical Spam Triggers
- Too many links (max 1-2)
- Images in cold emails
- Tracked links with suspicious domains
- No unsubscribe option (if bulk sending)

## 📧 Template 1: PubMed API

**Target:** CTOs at biotech/healthtech startups

### Initial Email

**Subject:** [COMPANY_NAME]'s literature search bottleneck

**A/B Test Variants:**
- "How [COMPETITOR] ships clinical features faster"
- "The PubMed integration your team needs"
- "Quick question about [COMPANY_NAME]'s research stack"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Noticed [COMPANY_NAME] is building [SPECIFIC_PRODUCT/FEATURE]. Guessing your team spends way too much time wrangling PubMed's clunky API—or worse, scraping.

We built a clean REST API for PubMed that handles the mess: proper pagination, structured JSON, semantic search across 35M+ papers. One endpoint, instant results.

Biotech teams using it have cut their literature integration time from weeks to hours.

Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits your stack?

### Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: [COMPANY_NAME]'s literature search bottleneck

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Quick bump on this—figured you're buried in more pressing fires.

One thing I didn't mention: our PubMed API handles citation graphs and related papers out of the box. Most teams bolt that on later and regret it.

If literature search isn't on the roadmap right now, no worries—happy to reconnect when it is.

## 📧 Template 2: ArXiv API

**Target:** ML engineers, research leads at AI companies

### Initial Email

**Subject:** Your RAG system's research blind spot

**A/B Test Variants:**
- "ArXiv search that doesn't suck"
- "[COMPANY_NAME] + real-time paper search?"
- "How [COMPETITOR] stays ahead on research"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Saw your work on [RECENT_PROJECT/PAPER/PRODUCT]. Impressive stuff.

Random question: how is [COMPANY_NAME] keeping your models updated with latest research? Most teams I talk to either ignore ArXiv entirely or have some janky cron job that breaks monthly.

We built an ArXiv API that gives you semantic search across 2M+ papers—structured metadata, abstracts, citations. Designed for RAG pipelines and research monitoring.

Curious if this would be useful for your team? Happy to give you API access to poke around.

**API:** https://arxiv.built-simple.ai

### Follow-up (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: Your RAG system's research blind spot

---

[FIRST_NAME],

Floating this back up—know AI teams move fast.

Thought you might find this interesting: we're seeing teams use the ArXiv API to auto-summarize weekly papers in their domain. Beats manually reading abstracts.

If you want to test it, reply "access" and I'll send creds. No call needed.

—[YOUR_NAME]

## 📧 Template 3: Wikipedia API

**Target:** Product managers at EdTech, RAG developers

### Initial Email

**Subject:** Wikipedia for [COMPANY_NAME]'s knowledge base

**A/B Test Variants:**
- "RAG grounding that actually works"
- "Your users deserve better answers"
- "Wikipedia API (but actually usable)"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Building knowledge features at [COMPANY_NAME]? Wikipedia's official API is... painful. Rate limits, weird XML, no semantic search.

We wrapped it in a clean REST API: full-text search, structured content extraction, 6M+ articles. Built specifically for RAG systems and EdTech products.

Teams use it for grounding LLM responses, building study tools, and powering knowledge graphs—without the Wikipedia API headaches.

Would it help to see how this could fit into [PRODUCT_NAME]?

### Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Wikipedia for [COMPANY_NAME]'s knowledge base

---

[FIRST_NAME],

Circling back on this one.

Quick use case that might resonate: one EdTech team uses our Wikipedia API to auto-generate quiz questions from any topic. Took them 2 days to build.

If grounding/knowledge isn't a priority right now, I'll back off—just let me know.

## 📧 Template 4: FixIt API

**Target:** Tech leads at repair platforms, DIY apps

### Initial Email

**Subject:** Repair knowledge for [COMPANY_NAME]

**A/B Test Variants:**
- "Your users are stuck on repairs"
- "The troubleshooting database you don't have"
- "[COMPANY_NAME] + instant repair answers?"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Saw [COMPANY_NAME] is in the [repair/DIY/home services] space. Question: where does your troubleshooting content come from?

Most repair apps either crowdsource (inconsistent) or license (expensive). We built a FixIt API with structured repair knowledge—searchable by symptom, device, or error code.

Think of it as a repair knowledge graph your app can query. Appliances, electronics, automotive, home systems.

Could save your content team a lot of pain. Worth a quick chat?

—[YOUR_NAME]

**API:** https://fixitapi.built-simple.ai

---

### Follow-up (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: Repair knowledge for [COMPANY_NAME]

---

[FIRST_NAME],

Following up—know you're probably slammed.

One thing repair platforms tell us: users bounce when they can't find answers. The FixIt API gives you instant, structured troubleshooting without building a content operation.

If this isn't the right time, happy to check back in a few months. Just say the word.
