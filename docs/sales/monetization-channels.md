Subject: Your Google reviews - responding manually?

Hey [Name],

Saw [Restaurant Name] has some great reviews on Google. Also noticed a few that haven't been responded to yet.

Built a tool that auto-responds to Google reviews with AI - context-aware, not templates. It reads the review, writes a real response, and posts it. No manual approval needed.

Takes about 3 minutes to connect. Want me to show you how it works?
